This is a sample shooter program used for a Master System programming tutorial at [https://www.elotrolado.net/hilo_tutorial-muy-basico-de-c-para-master-system_2208028]. It's aim is to show the capabilities of devKitSMS, PSGLib and GSLib for the creation of old style games in a 80's platform like the Master System. 

The source for the tutorial sits at [TUTORIAL.md]. It contains some first lessons done using some borrowed artistic material from Master System material. These first lessons cover from scratch to the use of scroll and sound. A new section, covering the use of GSLib and putting the previous knowledge together, explains how to program a little space shooter.
